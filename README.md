Donor History: Maintains a record of past donations, deferral periods, and special notes.
2. <b>Blood Inventory Management Blood Storage</b>: Manages the storage of blood units by blood type, component (e.g., whole blood, plasma, platelets), and expiration date.
Inventory Tracking: Monitors stock levels, alerts for low inventory or expired units, and tracks blood units through the processing stages.
3. <b>Blood Request and Issuance Request Management</b>: Handles requests from hospitals, clinics, and patients for specific blood types or components.
Blood Issuance: Records the details of blood unit issuance, including recipient information, quantity, and delivery details.
5. <b>Reports and Analytics Inventory Reports</b>: Provides detailed reports on blood inventory levels, usage patterns, and expiration dates.
